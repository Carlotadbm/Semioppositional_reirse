# Semioppositional_reirse
 
In this repository you can find the scripts and data for my paper:
De Benito Moreno, Carlota (accepted): “From (semi-)oppositional to non-oppositional middles: the case of Spanish reír(se), STUF – Language Typology and universals. Special issue.

At the moment (23/8/2022), scripts Section_4.2.R and Section_4.3_RAE.R are not working entirely, due to what it seems to be a bug in a modified version of slice_sample(), which seems to be getting fixed.
